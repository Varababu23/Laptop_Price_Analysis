**Laptop Price Analysis Using Python**
**Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing laptop prices using Python by exploring how different laptop specifications influence their market price. The dataset contains detailed information about various laptop models, including brand, type, screen size, RAM, processor, storage, GPU, display features, weight, and price.

The main objective of this project is to apply Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to clean the data, analyze relationships between features, and visualize important patterns in laptop pricing. This project was developed as a learning-based data analysis task and demonstrates foundational skills in Python, data preprocessing, and data visualization.

**Objectives of the Project**

Analyze laptop prices based on hardware and technical specifications

Understand the impact of RAM, CPU, GPU, storage, and display features on price

Apply data cleaning and preprocessing techniques

Perform exploratory data analysis using visualizations

Gain hands-on experience with real-world datasets

**Dataset Description**

The dataset contains laptop specifications and their corresponding prices in Euros. Each row represents a laptop, and each column represents a specific feature.

**Project Workflow**

Data Loading

Loaded the dataset using Pandas

Checked the shape and structure of the dataset

Reviewed sample records to understand the data

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Converted RAM values from text format to numeric values

Converted weight values from string to float format

Checked for missing and inconsistent values

Prepared the data for analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis

The following analyses were performed:

Distribution of laptop prices

Brand-wise price comparison

RAM vs price analysis

CPU and GPU impact on pricing

Storage type comparison (SSD vs HDD)

Display feature analysis (IPS, Retina, Touchscreen)

Weight vs price relationship

**Key Insights**

Laptops with higher RAM tend to have higher prices

Apple laptops are generally priced higher than many other brands

SSD storage significantly increases laptop price compared to HDD

Laptops with dedicated GPUs are more expensive

IPS and Retina displays contribute to higher pricing

Lightweight laptops are often priced higher

**Learning Outcomes**

Understanding of real-world data cleaning techniques

Practical experience in exploratory data analysis

Improved data visualization skills

Better understanding of how hardware specifications affect laptop pricing

Enhanced confidence in Python-based data analysis

**Future Improvements**

Build a machine learning model to predict laptop prices

Perform deeper brand-specific analysis

Add feature importance analysis

Create interactive dashboards for better visualization

**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates the application of exploratory data analysis techniques on a real-world dataset. It helped strengthen my understanding of data analysis concepts and improved my ability to extract meaningful insights from data. This project is suitable for academic purposes and as part of a beginner-level data analysis portfolio on GitHub.
